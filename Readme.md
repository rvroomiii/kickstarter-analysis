# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  We will use our data table to create the analysis of how the campaigns fared based on launch date and funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date showed that shows had a better chance of being successful during the months of May, June and July.  Shows in November and December were the least successful 
    

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals showed that shows with a goal of less than 1000 were more likely to be succesfful while shows with the largest kickstarter goal were more likely to fail.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####I found that the largest issues were double checking my formulas to ensure that I was getting the correct results.  Once I thought about the formula and double checked my work, the results came easily.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   ###As previously stated, based on the data it would show that shows released in the late spring and early summer perform better while shows released in December and Novemeber were less likely to be successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    ###As previously stated shows in the lower spectrum of cost had the highest chance to be successful while shows with very large goals were significantly less likely to be funded.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    ###The live outcomes were not considered in this dataset and we also did not look at the percentage of successful shows based on Launch Date.  It would be helpful to review the data in the same manner for both graphs and tables.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  ###I would create a table showing the outcomes by launch date using percentage of successful, canceled and failed to the total number of shows.
